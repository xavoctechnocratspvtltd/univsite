                   <h4>MOHANLAL SUKHADIA UNIVERSITY</h4> <strong>AN AGENDA FOR ACADEMIC REFORMS</strong>In the recent past, the Mohanlal Sukhadia University, Udaipur has initiated significant academic and administrative reforms in line with the XI Plan priorities and vision of higher education as 
      advocated by the Government of India. The basic purpose of these reforms has been to promote 
      the goals of equity, access and excellence. Foremost among these initiatives have been the 
      introduction of semester system at the post-graduate level, far-reaching changes in M.Phil. and 
      PhD programme, reforms in the examination pattern,  making the admission process more 
      transparent, giving more space to students form the tribal region of south Rajasthan, regular 
      updating of course contents, providing more internet access to faculty, researcher s and students. 


      These and similar such efforts have resulted in generating a better academic ambience in the 
      University. It is however felt that more needs to be done to build this University as a premier 
      institution of learning, research, extension and social outreach. 
      With this view, the University endeavors to introduce a host of reform measures at different levels. 


    These can be mentioned under the following major heads: <strong>(A)Academic Priorities and Social Responsibilities:</strong> 
<ul>

efforts have to be geared in this direction. The University looks forward to necessary support from 
the Government of Rajasthan in fulfilling these goals.&nbsp;
